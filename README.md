# actionableDLtesting

We establish this project for experiments of actionableDLtesting.

In file "backup" we place the simulated mutated test dataset. In file "code" is our experiment codes.

ModelA_raw.hdf5 and ModelB_raw.hdf5 are our raw trained DL models.

For example for model A, you can run order_retrainA.py with command "python order_retrainA.py" to get the results of our method BDP and RAM printed in the file order_resultA.txt.

You can run wrong_retrainA.py with command "python wrong_retrainA.py" to get the results of our method BDP and RAMF printed in the file wrong_resultA.txt.

You can run only_wrong_retrainA.py with command "python wrong_retrainA.py" to get the results of our method BDP and BDPF printed in only_wrong_resultA.txt.
